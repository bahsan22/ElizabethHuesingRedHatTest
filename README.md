## How to Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich
1. Collect your ingredients. You will want peanut butter, some jam or jelly, and some bread.
2. Spread peanut butter evenly onto one slice of bread using a knife.
3. Spread jelly or jam evenly onto the other slice of bread.
4. Press the two slices of bread together. (To avoid having peanut butter and jelly run everywhere, do this quickly.)
5. Cut the sandwich. The best way to cut the sandwich is diagonal, from one corner to another, giving you two triangle shaped pieces.
6. Enjoy your easy and yummy looking sandwich and be sure to share it with your new Red Hat colleagues!
